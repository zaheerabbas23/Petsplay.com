    <h3>SERVICE</h3>
    <p>The Petstore.com Service consists of a desktop and mobile web application that provides a hybrid peer-to-peer marketplace for pet-related services and products.</p>

    <p>With one exception (stated in the following paragraph), Petstore.com is not a Service Provider or Product Seller. Petstore.com is a peer-to-peer marketplace for persons seeking pet products and services (“Purchaser”), persons offering pet services (“Service Provider”), and persons selling pet products (“Product Seller”) to communicate and arrange for the purchase and provision of pet goods and services. We make no representations or warranties about the quality or legality of pet products or services offered on the marketplace by Service Providers or Product Sellers. Petstore.com does not employ, recommend, or endorse any Product Sellers or Service Providers, nor will Petstore.com be responsible or liable for the conduct, quality, performance, or safety of any Service Provider, Product Seller, or the products and services they sell. While Petstore.com may perform a background check or offer guidance to Service Providers or Product Sellers, We make no claims or guarantees about the products and services offered, or of those who offer them. You are solely responsible for your personal safety and the safety of your pet(s).</p>

    <p>As a Hybrid peer-to-peer marketplace, Petstore.com does offer some commercial products for sale under the user account name Petstore with the email sales@petstore.com. For these products only, Petstore.com is a Product Seller. For these products only, Petstore.com offers a return for refund or exchange on new and unused products within 60 days of the date your order shipped. Beyond 60 days, Purchasers must contact the manufacturer directly for warranty service. For all products not sold under the user account name Petstore, you must contact the Product Seller regarding any product issues.</p>

    <p>All transactions (with the exception of products sold by the user account Petstore) are between Purchasers and Service Providers or Product Sellers. Our Service is to provide a marketplace and facilitate payment. Your use of the Services is agreement that We have no liability or responsibility for damages, to you or your pet, resulting from any use or misuse of our Services. You are responsible for determining the quality, safety, and suitability of the service or product offered. Although We offer a system for the review of Product Sellers and Service Providers, We make no claim that any reviews are accurate.</p>

    <p>Purchasers are solely responsible for providing Service Providers with emergency medical contacts for the care of their pet as well as personal contact information for the duration of the service. In case of emergency, if you (the Purchaser) are not available to obtain immediate care, you (the Purchaser) authorize Us and the Service Provider to obtain and provision veterinary care. If We obtain emergency veterinary care for your pet, you authorize your veterinarian to release your pet records to Us. If you refuse any veterinary care suggested by the Service Provider or Us, you release the Service Provider and Us for any injury, damage, or liability arising from failure to seek veterinary care. Purchasers are solely responsible for cost and payment of any emergency medical care. In any case where emergency services may be required due to any fault or negligence on the part of the Service Provider, Purchasers are solely responsible for seeking any remuneration or damages directly from the Service Provider.</p>

    <p>Purchasers may request a service or product using the Services. When you request a service or product, you authorize Us to charge your credit card for the requested product or service. In requesting a product or service, you agree to pay the cost, plus fees and shipping. If you have questions about a product or service but do not want to make a transaction, you agree instead to contact the seller using the Services.</p>

    <p>Purchasers of pet services may only seek services for legally owned, vaccinated, and appropriately permitted pets in accordance with all local, state, and federal laws.</p>

    <p>Product Sellers and Service Providers, you have no obligation to provide a product or service until you accept a request from a Purchaser. You must accept the Purchaser’s request before it expires or the Purchaser is under no obligation to complete the transaction. You may not discriminate against other Users as stipulated in the Terms.</p>

    <p>Purchasers and Product Sellers or Service Providers who have entered into an agreement are responsible for performing their agreements. We are not a party to the agreement and have no obligation to perform any terms, excepting the facilitation of payment processing.</p>

    <p>Product sellers are only permitted to list and sell home made products, that is, products that are not made in a commercial manufacturing facility. Product sellers must be the maker of the products they sell. Under no circumstances may a Product Seller list or sell commercial or drop shipped products without Our express written consent. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to determine which products qualify as home made and to remove any products from the marketplace. </p>

    <p>Product Sellers of home made products must provide an accurate picture of the item offered. Purchasers acknowledge that most products sold on the Services are home made and may have unique features or imperfections. Product Sellers agree not to provide pictures that mask or hide any product imperfections.</p>

    <p>Service Providers must provide accurate pictures of any service areas, such as grooming or boarding facilities.</p>

    <p>You authorize Us to charge a listing, referral, or service fee on every transaction as stipulated in the Terms. Currently, we assess a 10% service fee on every transaction based on the total amount paid by the Purchaser.</p>

    <p>Reviews are an important part of the Services. You agree to only post information in reviews and feedback that accurately reflects your personal experiences. You may not use the Services to provide false or misleading information. If you are a Product Seller or Service Provider, you expressly may not post negative reviews for the purpose of drawing business from or hindering the business interests of another Product Seller or Service Provider. </p>

    <p>Purchasers of pet services are required to collect their pet at the end of any agreed service. Failure to retrieve a pet on time will result in additional charges and fees.</p>

    <p>If a pet has not been retrieved within seven days of the completion of service, regardless of communication with the Service Provider or Us, such abandonment of the pet will result in the pet being placed in foster care or under the care of animal control authorities. Purchasers of pet services agree to authorize Us to charge your method of payment for any costs we incur as a result of your failure to retrieve your pet.  You agree to indemnify Us from any additional costs or expenses we, or you, may incur as a result of your failure to retrieve your pet.</p>
